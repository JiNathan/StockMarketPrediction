Trump's administration wants to make U.S. tax reform competitive, Watson said during an interview on CNBC's \"Closing Bell.\" Specifically he discussed a proposed bill — a border-adjustment tax — that could hike rates on American imports. Despite concerns that a border tax could hurt oil prices, Chevron's Watson said industry imports would \"come into balance\" over time. \"The unpredictable effects of the U.S. dollar strengthening is what concerns a lot of people,\" he explained.(2017-03-07 00:00:00)\n",
            "71: House Foreign Affairs chairman blasts Trump administration for report on Soleimani killing: The chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Friday blasted the Trump administration for claiming in a new report that it had authority to order the controversial killing last month of Iranian Gen. Qasem Soleimani in Iraq under Congress' authorization in 2002 for the use of military force against Iraq.Rep. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., the committee's chairman, argued that the administration's new report to Congress about the Jan. 3 attack on Soleimani \"directly contradicts the President's false assertion that he attacked Iran to prevent an imminent attack against United States personnel and embassies.\"\"The administration's explanation in this report makes no mention of any imminent threat and shows that the justification the President offered to the American people was false, plain and simple,\" said Engel in a prepared statement.He and other Democrats already were skeptical about President Donald Trump's legal rationale for the attack without prior authorization from Congress.The administration's report made public Friday says that Trump \"directed this action in response to an escalating series of attacks in preceding months by Iran and Iran-back militias on United States forces and interests in the Middle East region.\"The report also said that the attack on Soleimani at Baghdad's airport was \"consistent with\" a \"longstanding interpretation of the President's authority\" under both Article II of the Constitution and the 2002 authorization of use of force in Iraq.Engel, in his statement, called that argument \"absurd.\"\"To make matters worse, to avoid having to justify its actions to Congress, the administration falsely claims Congress had already authorized the strike under the 2002 Iraq war resolution,\" Engel said.\"This legal theory is absurd. The 2002 authorization was passed to deal with Saddam Hussein,\" he said. \"This law had nothing to do with Iran or Iranian government officials in Iraq.\"The chairman added, \"To suggest that 18 years later this authorization could justify killing an Iranian official stretches the law far beyond anything Congress ever intended. I was pleased to join many of my colleagues in voting to repeal the outdated Iraq war authorization, and I hope the Senate will follow suit.\"In its report, the administration said the purpose of the attack on Soleimani was \"to protect United States personnel, to deter Iran from conducting or supporting further attacks against United States forces and interests, to degrade Iran's and [its] Qods Force-backed militias' ability to conduct attacks, and to end Iran's strategic escalation of attacks on, and threats to U.S. interests.\"At the time of his death, Soleimani, 62, was commander of Iran's Quds Force, the foreign operations wing of the elite paramilitary Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.Trump administration officials said after the strike that Soleimani had been planning imminent attacks on Americans and as a result had to be stopped.A week after his killing, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said, \"There was no doubt that there were a series of imminent attacks that were being plotted by Qasem Soleimani.\"But Pompeo, in an interview with Fox News, added, \"We don't know precisely when and we don't know precisely where, but it was real,\" Pompeo said in an interview that aired Thursday night on Fox News.NBC News reported in mid-January that Trump authorized Soleimani's killing seven months before he actually was killed.\"The presidential directive in June came with the condition that Trump would have final signoff on any specific operation to kill Soleimani,\" NBC reported, citing five current and former senior administration officials.NBC News noted that the timing of that directive \"could undermine\" the administration's already publicly stated rationale for the killing.(2020-02-14 00:00:00)\n",
            "86: Cruz sponsors bill allowing governors to deny entrance to refugees: Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Rep. Ted Poe reintroduced a controversial  bill that allows governors to bar refugees from entering their  state, The Hill reported.  The bill, entitled \"The State Refugee Security Act,\" was  initially introduced last year, The  Hill Reported on Tuesday. It would require federal authorities to notify a  state 21 days before settling a refugee there, during which the  governor can request \"adequate assurance\" that the  refugee is not a security threat. If the federal authorities can not provide this, the refugee will not be able to settle in the state.  \"The first obligation of the president is to keep this country  safe as commander in chief,\" Cruz said in a statement to The  Hill. \"I am encouraged that, unlike the previous  administration, one of President Trump's top priorities is to  defeat radical Islamic terrorism.\"The act echoes the sentiment of President Donald Trump's plan to bar Muslims from entering the United States.

In the time since Stewart left The Daily Show (on August 6,  2015), his many proteges have spread far and wide across the TV  landscape. Samantha Bee is on TBS. John Oliver has reached new  heights on HBO. Trevor Noah took over The Daily Show. And Stephen  Colbert has landed at CBS's Late Show. (Stewart himself has a  deal with HBO that he'll presumably start producing content for  one of these days.)  But something else happened in those 351 days: Donald Trump  became the Republican party's nominee for president. And in all  that time, doesn't it seem like Stewart would have some pretty  great jokes to share about a man he dubs an \"angry groundhog\"?

After he popped up on the latest episode  of Colbert's show (where he's been turning in appearances all  week), the host ceded the floor to his old boss, and Stewart  proceeded to lay into Fox News's praising of Trump — for the  exact same things they've criticized  for over the  course of his presidency.  (If you're wondering where Colbert was this whole time, he was  crouching just behind the desk, so he could pop up for the  occasional joke, as you'll see from this Tweet he shared.) Stephen Colbert tweet  It was a nice taste of vintage Jon Stewart, for all those who've  enjoyed the many, many shows his Daily  Show spawned but wanted something from the man himself.  He performed a quick tune from Hamilton. He dubbed  Sean Hannity \"Lumpy.\" He learned the hard way that he was on live  TV.  It was all a fun bit, made even more fun by Stewart's obvious  rustiness when it came to hosting a TV show. But the best part  was its conclusion: a lengthy, vintage rant from Stewart that  deserves to be quoted (mostly) in full. Stewart clearly stopped by Late  Show to offer his old pal a boost in the ratings  — creatively, the show is finally coming close to the  heights of The  Colbert Report, so this was a good time for  viewers to sample the program — but it was also fun to watch  him shake off the cobwebs and deliver jokes to a camera again.  Here's hoping the next time isn't another 351 days from  now.(2016-07-22 00:00:00)\n",

The White House previously stopped insisting on funding for a wall on the southern border as part of a bill to keep the government funded.While the solution right now is expected to be a short-term extension, Heitkamp is optimistic about a long-term solution.\"If we didn't think that we were there with a negotiated deal, I don't think we'd be agreeing on an extension.

The number of pages will probably be thousands of pages. I can't go to TurboTax,\" Bloomberg added.The remarks, which gave the impression that he was bragging about his wealth, drew boos from the audience in Las Vegas.

He is worth about $60 billion.But the question of his taxes is one that could haunt Bloomberg if he were to be the Democratic nominee in a general election. President Donald Trump long vowed to release his tax returns, but has yet to do so, claiming that he is under a constant state of audit that prevents him from making the returns public.In 2016 Trump was the first major party candidate in nearly 50 years not to release tax returns to the public.(2020-02-20 00:00:00)\n",

U.S. private employers stepped up hiring in November much  more than expected and consumer spending increased last month,  giving more ammunition to the Federal Reserve for a rate  increase.     The data helped the dollar climb half a percent against a  basket of major currencies after last week touching the highest  levels for almost 14 years.                Gold is highly sensitive to rising rates, which lift the  opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets such as bullion,  while boosting the dollar, in which it is priced.

            "158: Joe Biden unveils racial economic equity plan that calls for investment in minority businesses, workers: WASHINGTON — Former Vice President Joe Biden unveiled a roadmap of policy proposals Tuesday that are aimed at narrowing the generational wealth gap that persists between White Americans and their Black, Latino, Asian and Native American neighbors.Biden's racial economic equity plan is the fourth plank in the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee's \"Build Back Better\" economic platform. Biden announced the plan at a speech in Wilmington, Delaware. There, Biden drew a sharp contrast between his view of the national reckoning underway on racial justice and the ongoing protests in major cities, and the views of his opponent, President Donald Trump.\"Every instinct Trump has is to add fuel to the fire,\" said Biden. \"It's the last thing we need. We need leadership that will calm the waters and lower the temperature. That's how to restore peace in the streets.\" Biden's economic equity plan is largely a repackaging of dozens of his existing proposals from across the campaign's platforms, such as his plan to offer a one-time student debt reduction of $10,000 per student and his call for a $15 hourly minimum wage.It also contains a separate section focused on criminal justice reform, which includes Biden's plan to eliminate cash bail and to guarantee that formerly incarcerated people are provided temporary housing upon release from prison. It will take all of these policies working together, he said, to begin to achieve economic equality for people of color.\"How do we break the cycle? In good times, communities of color still lag. In bad times, they get hit first and the hardest. And in recovery, they take the longest to bounce back. This is about justice ... it's also about jobs, good-paying jobs. And financial stability, building wealth for families of color and passing it down to their kids.\"Here are some of the key proposals in Biden's economic equity plank: The New Markets Tax Credit program awards tax credits to investors who provide capital for community development entities, which finance projects in qualified low-income communities. Created by Congress in 2000, the NMTC has supported more than 5,300 projects in the past two decades, but it is scheduled to expire at the end of this year.Unlike the previous three planks in Biden's economic platform, the racial equity plan does not initially include demands for more federal spending. Instead, it is centered on the ways that funding Biden has already proposed in his first three planks is allocated. Speaking to reporters Tuesday morning, senior Biden campaign advisors said more details about the costs and the funding of these proposals are forthcoming, although they did not specify when to expect the numbers. One thing the plan does not contain is any reference to the word \"reparations,\" despite a growing movement on the left in recent years to quantify and compensate Black Americans for centuries of slave labor and for the subsequent Jim Crow laws that denied them access to the same opportunities to build wealth that White families were given.Grouping all of these policy proposals together under the umbrella of racial economic equity is one way for Biden's campaign to codify the former vice president's commitment to addressing the deep-seated racial injustice that has sparked massive civil unrest across the country this summer. Biden said his plan is \"about rising to this moment of crisis. Understanding people's struggles, and building a future worthy of their courage and their ambition to overcome.\"Read the entire plan below.(2020-07-28 00:00:00)\n",
